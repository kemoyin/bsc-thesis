% From Daniel Steinmetzer's dissertation
Systematically investigating a technical research topic and engineering the required tools is a demanding and interdisciplinary process. Most achievements could never evolve without collaborations in which colleagues and international partners integrated their intellectual forces. When working in teams, accounting particular contributions and components of the resulting publications to individual collaborators becomes almost impossible. This situation also applies to several contents of this thesis, which arise from collaborations, thus, cover joint contributions. Many of these collaborations persisted even longer than the research projects and became a long-term strategic partnership.
In our previous publications, all authors contributed by discussing ideas and debating on results throughout the whole project duration. Each of them has particular strengths that sometimes appear invisible. For this reason, I explicitly state and acknowledge---where possible---the contributions of my collaborators in the following.
